# Way to know executable name for an application to launch it in terminal.
# 1. If you know the name of the program, Try on the command line:
find /usr -name 'ipython'
# 2.1 To list all the running process with their PIDs
ps -e
# 2.2 Start the program which you are intended to know the name for
# 2.3 Switch to the terminal and retype command as in 2.1
# 2.4 Then on command line for the candidate "name_of_the_processes"
man name_of_the_process
# or
info name_of_the_process
# or
name_of_the_process -h

# In order to get PID of a process use the following command and click on the window.
xprop | grep PID
# Then use following to get further info
ps aux | grep <PID># without greater/less than sign.

# To create a bootable kali linux usb device, where name argument for
# iso file should match with the actual file name to be used. The 
# command should be run from the directory where the file is located 
# by changing directory by "cd" command.
dd if=kali-linux-2016.1-amd64.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=512k

# The alias command fixes the ls parameters.
# For example type following to see that the color output of ls command is fixed to auto.
alias ls

# To not use default alias in ls. This uses the ls command without the alias
\ls

# Another way to achieve the same is by unaliasing the ls command
unalias ls
ls

# To put back the alias in ls
alias ls ls --color=auto
ls

# A lot of commands in linux are aliases for the other commands(generally modified) so to know which alias is used when we actually enter command use:
which ls

# A long listing version of ls command is:
ls -l

# A long listing version of with all file and folder view can be executed as:
ls -al

# First column contains the user privilages to files/folders for several user ids. To see the different ids use:
id

# To see the files separated by comma use:
ls -m

# To reverse the file listing order use
ls -r

# To use special character to designate the list elements. For e.g. * is used for executable files and / is used for directories
ls -F

# Following command shows ordered list of files/folders sorted by date, most recently modified being shown at last
ls -lrt

# To recurse inside the current list of directories
ls -lRt

# Inside a directory, lists all the files with exe extension
ls -aF --file-type *exe

# "I" nodes for individual files, which is unique to each one of them, can be viewed by:
ls -li

# To link two files use ln command.
ln original_file_name link_file_name

# Now see how node for the individual file shows. It shows that those two files(original and the link files) are identical
ls -li

# The mentioned above node is an example of hard node. A soft node can be created as follows. Use the following command to see the type of file soft node creates
ln -s Original_file_name Soft_link_file_name
ls -li

# To view the contents of a file
cat "Desktop/Updating and Basics"

# To view detailed list of files in current dir
ls -l

# To view all files including system/hidden files
ls -a

# To view all files including system/hidden files in detailed view
ls -l -a

# To clear screen
clear

# To change the current working directory
cd Desktop

# To move to directory backwards from the current directory
cd ..

# To return to home from any current directory
cd

#We'll be working on Desktop directory, so...
cd Desktop

# To create a directory(in current directory)
mkdir Random_Dir

# To remove a directory(in current directory)
rmdir Random_Dir

# To create a file in current directory (Does not work if the name is already existing in the directory)
touch Name_of_File

# To copy a existing file
cp Name_of_File Name_of_File2
cp "Updating and Basics" "Updating and Basics_playable"

# To emulate renaming (Moving a file in the same directory with a different target name)
mv Name_of_File New_nameoffile

# To search a file for a word
grep emulate "Updating and Basics_playable"

# To compare two files
diff "Updating and Basics" "Updating and Basics_playable"

# To change the current password of the user
passwd

# To create a variable
Name=Deependra

# To display output in terminal
echo hey Deependra!

# To display the contents of a variable
echo $Name

# To see the help/info
info echo

# To turn the display off after 1 second:
sleep 1 && xset -display :0.0 dpms force off

# To execute an executable on a current directory.
./executable_name

# To open a file or a directory with suitable application use. For example to open the current directory (Home for the user). This may be supplemented by sudo command to provide root access.

# You can upgrade smoothly through LTS releases whether it's Server or Desktop. # It doesn't matter what you use, you just need to use these commands:
# For Desktop Version:
sudo do-release-upgrade

# For Server Version:
sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
sudo do-release-upgrade

# In order to upgrade the whole distribution use:
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

# To turn the display off after 1 second:
sleep 1 && xset -display :0.0 dpms force off
