# Programming Notes

## R, Excel and Python

Should contain petty notes on problems I face in day-to-day programming. It's kindda dumping ground for small tasks that have not yet been organized into projects. This repo hosts mostly disorganized scripts that fit nowhere but are too valuable that they impinge when I have to search around elsewhere for them.

There also are some fancy ones that caught my eyes in the web. Those mostly relate to concepts in computing, mathematics and statistics.

1. [Excel tips and tricks](/excel_tips_tricks/)
2. [Create hex stickers using R](/r_hex_sticker.R)
3. [Recursion based sudoku solver(/Recursion based sudoku solver.ipynb)]: This was copied and pasted from youtube webcast by [NerdFirst programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ahOBeyM40)
4. Utility functions and scripts in R for easing chores.

## Words on git

To be real, we all start from the scratch when we embark anywhere. That's somewhat the same story with this repository too. I'd rather quote the exact lines which I wrote during my initial days with git, however quoting myself from that so early, even today, I realize, it's not drastically different either from the whole idea about the creation of the repo.

> Repo mainly deals with learning git rather than using it.
>
> Much of the contents in this repo will be erroneous rather than useful. This is because, a lot of time invested herein will be my attempts to improve in the use of Git.

## Learning Linux

This repo will contain mostly the commandline tricks for linux terminals and simple tweaks.
The repository is inspired by various online tutorials including the ebooks and the videos on managing linux operating system. For my own intent, I'm listing some of the useful threads I found around in stackoverflow:
