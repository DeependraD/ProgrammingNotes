Should contain petty notes on problems I face in day-to-day programming. It's kindda dumping ground for small tasks that have not yet been organized into projects.

2. [Create hex stickers using R](/r_hex_sticker.R)
3. [Recursion based sudoku solver(/Recursion based sudoku solver.ipynb)]: This was copied and pasted from youtube webcast by [NerdFirst programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ahOBeyM40)
