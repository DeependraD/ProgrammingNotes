# Programming Notes

Should contain petty notes on problems I face in day-to-day programming. It's kindda dumping ground for small tasks that have not yet been organized into projects. This repo hosts mostly disorganized scripts that fit nowhere but are too valuable that they impinge when I have to search around elsewhere for them.

There also are some fancy ones that caught my eyes in the web. Those mostly relate to concepts in computing, mathematics and statistics.


1. [Excel tips and tricks](/excel_tips_tricks/)
2. [Create hex stickers using R](/r_hex_sticker.R)
3. [Recursion based sudoku solver(/Recursion based sudoku solver.ipynb)]: This was copied and pasted from youtube webcast by [NerdFirst programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ahOBeyM40)
4. Utility functions and scripts in R for easing chores.
