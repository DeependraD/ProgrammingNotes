# Version control using git

## Starting words

To be real, we all start from the scratch when we embark anywhere. That's somewhat the same story with this repository too. I'd rather quote the exact lines which I wrote during my initial days with git, however quoting myself from that so early, even today, I realize, it's not drastically different either from the whole idea about the creation of the repo.

> Repo mainly deals with learning git rather than using it.
>
> Much of the contents in this repo will be erroneous rather than useful. This is because, a lot of time invested herein will be my attempts to improve in the use of Git.
