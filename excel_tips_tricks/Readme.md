# Introduction to MS excel convenient function

HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP are a class of convenience function that are shipped with recent versions of Excel.

HLOOKUP: Look up row indices

VLOOKUP: Look up column indices

An example file (hlookup.xlsx) is embedded in this directory which shows an example case of `hlookup` function.

Convenience functions for descriptive analytics and few additions on inference have been made. Currently, the added files themselves document the process of data munging through the formulas and organized structures.
