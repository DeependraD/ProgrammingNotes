### To search and replace some strings use following:
1. `:%s/==.*/ `
  - `%s` searches for the string in all lines, not only in the current line.
  - `/` performs forward search. `?` should perform a backward search.
  - `==.*` is the search pattern where any string with any number of characters preceded by "==" will be matched.
  - `/ ` (notice there is a space char) specifies that match be replaced by " "(a space).

2. `:%s/==.*//d`
