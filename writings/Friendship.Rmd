The world is shrinking, as we all gather around in an interwoven sphere of social media. “Sending a friend request”, “suggesting a friend to befriend someone-else”, “unfriend with someone”, etc., all these instances of friendship are being frequented, since past few years as digital technology continues to pervade most of our lives. But, has the friendship lost it's profoundness in meaning? Is it just a relationship status or is different to, when at times, live meet-ups of friends were more frequent or when greater engagement occurred through pen and paper? 

For me, It sure isn't just the relationship status, nor has any fundamentals of friendship changed since forever . Moreover, only now It's becoming clearer that friendship transcends much wider, as it is more than just coming together of two unrelated peoples.

Peoples bond. When married, two persons become related, formally and legally. A child ties to its parents both genetically(also called the blood relationship) and legally. In general, institutions and bondage frameworks are sought for when trying to define relationship between peoples. Friendship, as a relationship, marks an exception to this convention. Peoples don't need to be related- legally, or through blood or kinship, nor are they required to meet any physical or emotional criteria to make friends. There's no restrictions as to what age, sex, physique, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, political alignment a prospective friend should be; If imposed any, however, It's purely arbitrary. Thus, any two persons can be friends, given that they both agree to that.

There's a popular saying around south-east: “Praying the god only at times of odds”. Maybe the reward pathway of human brain is domineering the sufferings' one, or maybe it's just the human nature that we remember our dearest ones at times when we are most vulnerable. Be it dealing with physical exertions or tackling the haunting dilemmas, at times, we all seek support- a helping hand when exhausting after toil, a soothing voice of appreciation after an episode of mental ordeal, or only a spectator. Sometimes just the presence, however passive it may be, of ones we know will lighten us up. In today's world of breakneck speed, too often than not one may find themselves in loneliness, a mental complex that even has severed lives out of peoples while leaving others depressed and neurotic.

Every-time we feel lonely, to expect that members of one's family would be around is unrealistic. Growing up, getting a profession or leading a family of oneself, either of these might make it more harder to ensure company of kins and relatives. Thus, a need for more flexible relationship, unbounded unlike kinship or professional relationship, arises. A friend can be a place to share moments- happy or sad, a staking support when going through hardships. Peoples earn friends out of difficult situations. To this end, one must be willing to provide unconditional support, mostly at times of need, without greed or expectations. It can, therefore, be said that a true test of friendship is best taken at times of trouble. Real friends need to have an unflinching faith upon one another, or else the relationship won't last any long.

Opening up to another person makes our problems feel lighter. Naturally, one should talk to those who are witting. Friends tend to have similar likeness and contrast among them. One might have gone through similar but well sorted out experiences, which is benefiting to the partner. A good friend acts as an advisor, providing constructive suggestions and cautions. Not everybody heed to the problem of others, if they do , however, as a friend, valuable insights could be gained. After-all, there is strength in unity. 

Peoples turn to all sorts of places and things for inspiration; They idealize famous personalities, admire them, and sometimes even ascribe to their accomplishments. If looked upon thoughtfully, A friend can be an inspiration. He/she will pat on the back while you take a step further, unawry. Several instances in the past where a king or a noble man has demonstrably praised their friend can be seen. Even the greatest conquerors have attributed their victories as being inspired by the support of friends- the allies.

Just as it's easy befriending someone, It's equally easy to alienate them too. We all can't agree to something at all times. Good friends respect each other's opinions and convene to settle the differences. In the course, they may even agree to disagree. Depending upon one's personal understanding and/or state of affairs one may loose faith, feel disparaged, or treated unfair. This marks the rift in their friendship. Once best friend could then become dreaded enemy, one with all the secrets shared and weaknesses exposed.

Friendship, a tie very fragile, yet so sweet, is far-reaching in a person's life. To have a good friend is like having the god by your side, that watches upon you for good. A remedy to loneliness, a caretaker, a source of inspiration, and when the tides turn, ones to frown upon. All in all, friendship is a relation that we should all should strive to prop up, if not cherish.
